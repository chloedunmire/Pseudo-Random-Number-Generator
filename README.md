# Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator
Here is a new version of a pseudo-random number generator that includes two particles that bounce around inside of a Sinai Billiard. The particles bounce off of walls and teleport through walls. Collision coordinates are gathered at a circular center wall in order to produce pseudo-random sequences of binary digits.
